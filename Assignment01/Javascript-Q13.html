<p>Q13: Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, 
    such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. 
    Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as 
    “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”</p>

            'I would like to have a Metaverse Car',<br />
            'Color of the Car should be Golden',<br />
            'This should be a flying Car',<br />

        <br />
        //looping stetements from array<br />
        for(i = 0; i < statements.length; i++) {<br />
